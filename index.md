Parsers
=======

##### Ply

PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.

##### PyParsing

The pyparsing module is an alternative approach to creating and
executing simple grammars, vs. the traditional lex/yacc approach, or
the use of regular expressions. The pyparsing module provides a library
of classes that client code uses to construct the grammar directly in
Python code.

##### Parsimonious

Parsimonious aims to be the fastest arbitrary-lookahead parser written
in pure Python. It's based on parsing expression grammars (PEGs), which
means you feed it a simplified sort of EBNF notation. Parsimonious was
designed to undergird a MediaWiki parser that wouldn't take 5 seconds or
a GB of RAM to do one page.

Syntax Definition
-----------------

##### ASDL

The Zephyr Abstract Syntax Description Lanuguage (ASDL) is a language
designed to describe the tree-like data structures in compilers. Its
main goal is to provide a method for compiler components written
in different languages to interoperate. ASDL makes it easier for
applications written in a variety of programming languages to
communicate complex recursive data structures.

##### asdl_py

Metaprogramming
---------------

##### Basil

##### Mython


Mython is an extensible variant of the Python programming language.
Mython makes Python extensible by adding two things: parametric
quotation statement, and compile-time metaprogramming. The parametric
quote statement is simply syntactic sugar for saying "run some function
on this embedded string". Compile-time metaprogramming allows you to
evaluate that function on the embedded string at compile time. This
gives you added choice, both in terms of what your code looks like, and
when you want to evaluate that code.

- [Website](http://www.mython.org)

##### Cog

Cog is a Python source generation library. Cog transforms files in
a very simple way: it finds chunks of Python code embedded in them,
executes the Python code, and inserts its output back into the original
file. The file can contain whatever text you like around the Python
code.

##### LLVMPy

llvmpy is a Python wrapper around the llvm C++ library which allows

Compilers
---------

##### Cython

The Cython language is a superset of the Python language that
additionally supports calling C functions and declaring C types on
variables and class attributes. This allows the compiler to generate
very efficient C code from Cython code. The C code is generated once and
then compiles with all major C/C++ compilers.

Copperhead is a project to bring data parallelism to Python. Copperhead
defines a small functional, data parallel subset of Python, which is
then dynamically compiled and executed on parallel platforms. Currently,
Copperhead targets NVIDIA GPUs, as well as multicore CPUs through OpenMP
and Threading Building Blocks (TBB).
